Created a small app that polls an Api every 10 second.  
The data that gets send from the Api gets logged to std out.  

Feel free to use this here for any ticker application that is needed to fetch data into a pipeline or its like. 

The project is part of a larger setup to showcase GCP dataflow using [SCIO](https://spotify.github.io/scio/index.html) to enrich data fetched with this here ticker application.
